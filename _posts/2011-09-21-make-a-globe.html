<p>This is a fun project for 1st-6th  grade. The age of the child will determine how much adult help they will need. I made the mistake of letting each of my 24 1st graders make their own. Next year the class will make one as a group.</p>
<p>This is a great Earth Day Project but you can also use it as a tie in to a lot of social studies themes. I did endangered animals of the world and combined it with maps and learning about the Earth.</p>
<p>1. Paper mache a balloon 2. paint  3. We decorated  our globes with clay animals attached by an adult with a glue gun.</p>
