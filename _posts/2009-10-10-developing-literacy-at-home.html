<blockquote>I thought kindergarten was all about socialization. However that seems to have changed and learning to read seems to be a priority. What can I do at home to help my son succeed?</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to the homework assignments your son's teacher may give him, there are millions of ways in which you can foster your child’s literacy development. Here are a few examples of activities that parents of kindergarten and first grade students can utilize to support their child’s literacy development at home. </p>
<p> 1)  Go to the library often and let your child pick the books that interest him and read together for at least 30 minutes a day.</p>
<p> 2)  Do a “picture walk” before you read a book.  Go through the pictures page by page and talk about what is probably happening in the story.  Use the illustrations in a book to help decode the text.  Discuss your child’s predictions as you follow up by reading together.  </p>
<p> 3)  Talk about the beginning, middle and ends of books you read as well as the characters and setting. </p>
<p> 4)  Ask questions about books that you read aloud to see if your child comprehends.  Discuss and explain. </p>
<p> 5)  Read lots of nursery rhymes (to help develop phonemic awareness) and predictable stories. </p>
<p> 6)  Encourage your child to retell favorite stories to you using puppets or dolls. </p>
<p> 7)  Help your child learn to identify letters and their sounds. </p>
<p> 8)  Make flash cards of easy basic “sight words” (the, go, like, can, we, went, etc.)  and look for them in books.  </p>
<p> 9)  Make a game of reading environmental print (fast food restaurant names, grocery stores, food labels, gas station names, street signs, etc.).</p>
<p> 10)  Help your child label pictures with words that you sound out together. </p>
<p> 11)  Write grocery lists together.</p>
<p>12)  Help your child make mini-story booklets.  Start by using three pieces of paper, one page each for the beginning, the middle and the end.</p>
