<p>                                                                             PUPPETS!</p>
<p>Puppets can be a great way to spend a rainy summer day. You can purchase them or make sock or paper bag puppets at home. Your local library should have some interesting craft books on a variety of puppets that kids can create. Use a large box to make and decorate a puppet theater, or just have the performers sit or stand behind a piece of furniture.</p>
<p>WHY PUPPETRY?</p>
<p>1) Puppetry helps develop creative expression through dramatic play.</p>
<p>2) Performing helps a child to learn to speak clearly in order to better convey ideas.</p>
<p>3) It promotes voice pitch, tone, volume and gives children a chance to act out emotions.</p>
<p>4) Puppetry expands vocabulary as children come up with just the right word and personality for their puppet.</p>
<p>5) Puppets are good practice for storytelling.</p>
