<p>This 12 month calendar is a great holiday gift for parents. The artwork can be 12 simple pictures or you can have the children create different types of art for a greater variety of work. Some of my favorites are: a self portrait, collage, crayon resist, watercolors, string painting,marble painting, golf ball painting, sponge or finger painting, or a simple picture that goes with the season or holiday of the month.</p>
