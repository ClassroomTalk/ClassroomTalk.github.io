<p>I love to make this easy potholder for parents at Christmas or Mother's Day. I usually attach  this poem. All you need is fabric paint, a tiny hand and a plain potholder. It takes me about a half an hour to do 24 hands!</p>
<p>Poem</p>
<p>Sometimes you get discouraged</p>
<p>Because I am so small</p>
<p>And always leave my fingerprints</p>
<p>On furniture and walls.</p>
<p>But everyday I’m growing</p>
<p>I’ll be grown up someday</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-638" title="PotHolder" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2011/07/classroomtalk-pictures-180-300x226.jpg" alt="PotHolder" width="300" height="226" /></p>
<p>And all those tiny fingerprints</p>
<p>Will surely fade away.</p>
<p>So here’s a final fingerprint</p>
<p>Just so you can recall</p>
<p>Exactly how my fingers looked</p>
<p>When I was very small.</p>
