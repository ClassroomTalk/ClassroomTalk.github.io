<p>The future seems to already be with us, and
has sprung upon many of us without us knowing.
10 years ago if someone had said you can get any book you have ever
wanted on a one inch think tablet that you can hold in your hands, you would
probably have laughed at them.  Nowadays
it’s a realistic option, and with the advent of the various eBook readers
around the globe you can hold thousands of books literally in your pocket - if
you have a big enough one anyway!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Engaged
learning with an eBook?</strong></p>
<p>How does this benefit the reader though,
and can it benefit children and people in the classroom?  There is no doubt that having those kind of
resources literally at your finger tips will help hundreds, maybe even millions
of people understand the world that is available if they begin to read
books.  Having this kind of resources
will also give people the opportunity to study books in a way that fits in in
the age we live in.  I know from personal
experience that in the classroom some people are completely turned off when a
book is put in front of them, but if you give them a Kindle of an iPad with the
same book available to them then they will be more engaged.  How many of you know children who are happy
to play Xbox all day, but if you stick the latest childrens novel in front of
them they laugh.  Give them an iPad with
interaction within the story and I can guarantee it will be a different
reaction, imagine a world where an encyclopaedia not only gives us words and
pictures, but also videos, at the touch of a screen, in class.  The eBook reader can engage children and
adults alike at different levels compared to the printed book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Far
more benefits than you’d think</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst it may be easier to engage children
with an eBook reader, there are other things to consider as well, and benefits
which are simply not available with the printed book.  For example, both you can your children can
hold far more books than ever before in your house, no need to build a library
when you can have thousands of books in your hand.  You can zoom in on a page, and I know myself
that some children, despite what you say will literally bury their head into a
book to be able to read it properly – the eBook reader can help.  Another exciting move is the ability to
change the background colour, some people find reading black on white extremely
hard, and in the classroom this could be a real benefit to help people learn
and encourage their academic side.  There
is no doubt that certain elements of the eBook reader are helpful in both a
personal and educational sense, and they should not just be dismissed out of
turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall it is clear the eBook readers can benefit
you and also can benefit children that you work with.  Perhaps it wont is a standard for a few years
yet, but the benefits eBook readers can bring to the classroom cannot be
underestimated and one day perhaps everyone will learn to love to read once
again.</p>
