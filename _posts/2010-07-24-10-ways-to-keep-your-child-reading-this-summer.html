<p align="center">     Children that don’t read over the summer usually regress and return to school at a lower reading level in the fall.  Here are 10 easy ways to keep your child reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>1.  Go to the library once a week and let your child pick out a pile of books that will last a week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.  Let them read almost anything they like.  Comic books for example can be relaxing and fun for a change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.  Let your child subscribe to one or more age and subject appropriate magazines that interest him or her.  Among the many that are written for specific ages include<em> Sports Illustrated Kids, Ranger Rick, Nickelodeon, American Girl, and Highlights</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.  Let them use the computer/library to research topics of interest to them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.  Find mystery or puzzle books which encourage children to solve a mystery through clues in the text.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAK064?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=classrelemen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000UAK064">THE ELEVENTH HOUR, A CURIOUS MYSTERY: An elephant's 11th birthday party is marked by 11 games before the banquet to be eaten at the 11th hour, but when the time to eat arrives, the b-day feast has disappeared. Reader is invited to guess the thief.</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=classrelemen-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000UAK064" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>6.  Let them stay up an extra hour to read before going to bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>7.  Hook them on a good book series.  They’ll be anxious to finish one story and begin another. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>8. Put a time limit on video game use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>9.  Be a good role model, let your children see you reading.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>10.  Read a book before attending summer movies and compare and contrast them.</p>
