<p>Puppets can be a great way to encourage children to invent stories. You can purchase them or make sock or paper bag puppets at home. Your local library should have some interesting craft books on a variety of puppets that kids can create. Use a large box to make and decorate a puppet theater, or just have the performers sit or stand behind a piece of furniture. In my classroom, I use a puppet theater as a writing center. Children write story scripts and then act them out with a partner using hand  puppets.</p>
<p>WHY PUPPETRY?</p>
<p>1) Puppetry helps develop creative expression through dramatic play.</p>
<p>2) Performing helps a child to learn to speak clearly in order to better convey ideas.</p>
<p>3) It promotes voice pitch, tone, volume and gives children a chance to act out emotions.</p>
<p>4) Puppetry expands vocabulary as children come up with just the right word and personality for their puppet.</p>
<p>5) Puppets are good practice for storytelling.</p>
