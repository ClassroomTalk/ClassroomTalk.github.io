<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">College Entrance Exams: Raising Scores with Free
Prep Courses</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guest Post By:  Kate Willson</span></strong></p>
<p>Recent SAT test scores show that the average
critical reading section score is the lowest it has been since 1972. The high
school graduating class of 2012 received an average score of 496, out of a
possible 800. The average score for writing has also dropped by six points
since College Board, the organization that administers the test, first began
testing for it in 2006. In addition to these numbers, the overall SAT score has
continued to remain below average in several states throughout the years, and
this year didn’t show much improvement.</p>
<p>These reports raise serious concerns among teachers
and parents who see poor college entrance exam results as proof that the
education system in the United States is not succeeding. Unfortunately, it is
nearly impossible to find one solid reason for these consistently poor test
scores. In fact, there are several reasons why students are not doing well, so
instead of discussing all the possible roots of the problem, let’s look at one
possible solution.</p>
<p>According to past articles written on the subject,
most students believed that completing a SAT prep course helped significantly
increase their test scores. On the flip side, there are also articles that say
prep classes aren’t always worth the money, because they only increase scores
by a marginal amount. However, even if a course only helps raise a student’s
score by a few points, those few points could make the difference between
college admittance and rejection. The general consensus seems to be that prep
courses are beneficial, but only if the sign-up fee is inexpensive. As for
proof that courses do increase scores, <a href="http://collegeapps.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=collegeapps&amp;cdn=education&amp;tm=199&amp;f=20&amp;su=p284.13.342.ip_&amp;tt=12&amp;bt=1&amp;bts=1&amp;zu=http%3A//www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/coaching.pdf">College
Board</a> and the <a href="http://collegeapps.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=collegeapps&amp;cdn=education&amp;tm=221&amp;f=20&amp;su=p284.13.342.ip_&amp;tt=12&amp;bt=1&amp;bts=1&amp;zu=http%3A//www.nacacnet.org/research/research-data/Documents/TestPrepDiscussionPaper.pdf">National
Association of College Admission Counseling</a> have conducted studies that
show they do.</p>
<p>Some would argue that most students are already
taking prep courses, and that the continued weakness in scores proves that
these courses do not work. This may be true, in some school districts. However,
it is also true that many more students all across the nation cannot afford
courses or choose not to attend, because they do not believe the benefits will
outweigh the costs.</p>
<p>Students who do not attend courses to prepare for
college entrance exams often choose to study for the test independently by
using free example tests on the SAT’s official website, and some do nothing to
prepare. Although students who choose to prepare independently do succeed,
courses discuss each test section and effective test-taking methods on a much
wider scale. They also give students the chance to take multiple example tests
that are timed and conducted just as the real test is.</p>
<p>So, while success rates for various SAT prep methods
vary, one thing is certain; prep courses can and do give students an advantage.
When discussing solutions to the low score problem, schools should consider
this advantage and understand the unfairness of charging a high fee for SAT
prep classes. Already, schools across the country are beginning to see the
importance of offering free prep courses after school. For example, T.C.
Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, offered free ACT and SAT prep
programs to juniors for the first time this year. The classes were taught by an
outside company and were voluntary.</p>
<p>Because college applicants do not have a choice on
whether or not to take a college entrance exam, high schools need to find a way
to provide every student with all the resources they need to succeed. Money
should not be an issue, and the resources should not be difficult to attain. In
addition to providing free prep courses, schools should also provide up-to-date
prep guides in their libraries and inform students on where to find more
information about signing up and preparing for the SAT or ACT. Once more
schools begin to take an active role in preparing students for not only college
entrance exams but college in general, the results will follow, and I believe
they will be positive.</p>
