<div><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-659" title="bunny" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2011/07/classroomtalk-pictures-124_rotated-226x300.jpg" alt="bunny" width="226" height="300" /><p>Every spring when we talk about recycling and reusing my class makes these Bunny Baskets. All you need is a an empty clean gallon size water/milk jug cut by an adult into a basket  shape.  Create a bunny face with pom poms and plastic eyes. Cover the remaining space with white glue and add white cotton balls.  Staple tag board ears covered in felt to the back of the basket. We usually celebrate spring by filling them with treats!  </p></div>
