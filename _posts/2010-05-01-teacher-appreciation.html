<blockquote> May 7-11th is National Teacher Appreciation Week.  All over the country schools and PTAs will be celebrating teachers and all they do to educate children.  Take time out this weekend to put some thought into all the time and effort your child’s teacher puts forth to help your child, and how you can show your thanks for those efforts.  A great way to do this is with a letter letting the teacher know the many ways they are appreciated.  Just like all you parents out there that save the cards and art work that your children make at school, teachers save these notes as fond reminders of why they teach.  The best gifts that I have received over the years are the ones from the heart that let me know that parents are aware of the energy and enthusiasm that I put into the care and education of their children.</p></blockquote>
