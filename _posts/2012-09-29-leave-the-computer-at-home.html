<p><strong>Leave the Computer at Home: Why Taking College Notes
in a Journal is a Better Idea</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guest Post By Maria Rainier</strong></p>
<p>There is nothing more I love in this world than my
Apple Macbook computer. It's perhaps the single greatest investment I've ever
made in my life, and, no, I'm not exaggerating. As a full-time writer, I
greatly depend upon my computer to help me put together my work each and every
day. If there was ever a time I didn't depend upon my computer, however, it was
in college. While other students would pull out their laptops during class, I'd
reach for a ballpoint pen and a wire-bound journal to take my notes. It might
seem odd for a girl who loves her computer so much to forgo a laptop in the
classroom, but the truth is that I knew the benefits of not using a computer
during class. For those of you who are new to the college classroom, here are
three reasons why a journal is a better idea to take notes in than a laptop
computer.</p>
<p><strong>Journals
are less distracting</strong></p>
<p>Computers are one of the most distracting forces on
the planet. Not only are they full of innovative, exciting programs, but they
also have the ability to access the Internet. Though you may think you have the
self-discipline to stop yourself from going online and looking at blogs,
Facebook, Twitter, etc. during college classes – it's much easier said than
done. A computer is essentially a vessel of distractions, and as most any
college student will tell you, it's never good to be distracted during class.
Inevitably, you'll miss your teacher going over the key concepts and theories
you'll need to understand in order to succeed in the class. With a journal,
however, you'll be able to focus on the class and give your professor the full
attention he or she deserves.</p>
<p><strong>Journals
won't crash on you</strong></p>
<p>Almost every person I've met has had their computer
crash at least once. I personally had mine crash during my sophomore year of
college, which – at the time – seemed like an absolute disaster. I had stored
countless class and work documents on my computer that I wasn't able to ever
restore. If you take class notes on your computer, you always risk losing
documents through computer crashes. Journals, on the other hand, never stand
the chance of crashing. As long as you don't lose your journal or get caught in
a nasty rainstorm, you never have to fear losing all your important class
notes.</p>
<p><strong>Journals
have more personality</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest thing about journals is that
you can diversify the notes you take inside of them. With computers, you're
restricted to taking notes in mundane programs like Word or PowerPoint, which
severely limits the diversity and creativity of your content. Journals, on the
other hand, allow you to do useful things like draw pictures and write in short
abbreviations that can greatly aid you in your studies. Although computers might
be more innovative, journals definitely have more personality.</p>
<p>Technology is finding its ways into college
classrooms and our everyday lives, but that doesn't mean we have to surrender
ourselves to its force all the time. If you want to succeed in taking thorough,
effective notes, always choose a journal over a computer.</p>
