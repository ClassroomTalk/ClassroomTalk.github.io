<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>This is the story of Ben and
Rose.  Fifty years apart in time, they
are each struggling at home and face further challenges because they are deaf.
In 1927, Rose longs for a mother who just can't be there for her. In 1977, Ben
longs for a mother who recently died and a father he has never met. With hope
in their hearts, both children leave home alone in search of their dreams in
New York City. When their stories become intertwined, Ben and Rose discover
something wonderful that they hadn't even set out to find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here
is the scoop:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Written by the highly
decorated author of <em>The Adventures of Hugo Cabret</em>, <em>Wonderstuck</em> is
another beautifully conceived novel that alternates between pictures and words.
The illustrations that tell the story of Rose communicate as powerfully as the
words that tell the story of Ben. Both characters run away from home on
parallel journeys--one in search of an absentee mother, and the other in search
of the father he has never met. The fact that they are deaf does not stop
either child from pursuing their dreams or overcoming obstacles. There is an
interesting theme about a person being like a cabinet of wonders in a museum.
Each person has the opportunity to curate the objects that go in their cabinet
in order to tell the story of who they are. Readers who enjoy science will
delight in this story's primary setting--the Museum of Natural History in New
York City.  <em>Wonderstruck</em> could be enjoyed either by an independent reader or as
a classroom read-aloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy
reading!</p>
