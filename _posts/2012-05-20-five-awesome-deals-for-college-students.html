<p>Guest Post By Aaron</p>
<p>Going to college can be an exciting experience, but most
college students don't exactly have a lot of cash to spare. By the time you
somehow find enough money to pay for tuition, books, lab fees, room and board, and
anything else you need for class, there isn't much left over. Luckily, there
are a number of companies who market to college students and understand that
many of them are financially challenged. If you are a college student, there
are a few different ways that you could save money on the things that you need
to buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting Things Done</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are going to school, it can be very difficult
to keep up with all of the things that you have to do. You might have a test
that you need to study for in Econ, while at the same time you have to work on
a presentation in your Management class. By the time you get home from your
part-time job and visit with your roommates, you might have a hard time
remembering all the things that you need to do. If you find yourself in this
situation, using an application known as Producteev can be a lifesaver.
Producteev is an advanced "to do list" and it is available for free
for anyone who signs up with a college email address. This program will help
you room are all of the things that you have to do and allocate specific
amounts of time for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saving on Textbooks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the biggest expenses that you have to incur every
semester is paying for textbooks. The textbook companies aren't exactly lining
up to discount their prices even though they know college students don't have a
lot of money. However, this doesn't mean that you have to spend an arm and a
leg when it comes to getting access to the textbooks you need. One option to
consider is renting the textbooks from a local bookstore. Instead of paying
full price for the books, you just pay a nominal monthly fee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option to consider is getting them from Amazon
on a Kindle. Amazon offers a textbook rental service that is as much as 80
percent cheaper than paying for the book. You can read the book on your Kindle,
on a computer or on a device like your iPhone or iPad. You can rent the book
for as little as 30 days or as long as a year. You can even extend your rental
period for a single day if you need to. This really is the cheapest way to get
access to the textbooks that you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wi-Fi Access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you're in college, you need to be able to get on
the Internet all the time. Whether you're getting a copy of the notes from a
class you missed or watching an online lecture, you need Internet access. With
the help of Connectify, this process can be a little bit easier. With
Connectify, you can turn any Windows computer into a wireless hotspot. You
don't even need to buy any additional hardware to make it work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you sign up for the service with a college e-mail
address, you will not have to pay the standard fee for the service. Once you
sign up, you download a software program to your computer and then it creates a
Wi-Fi network for you. You will then have the ability to connect to the Wi-Fi
network with your smartphone, tablet computer or laptop without any problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>File Sharing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you access files in multiple locations, having access
to a file sharing service can be invaluable. Dropbox is one of the best known
file sharing services available. If you're a college student and you sign up
with your college email address, you're going to be able to access the service
absolutely free.</p>
