<p>How to Engage Students</p>
<p>1.  Practice your stand-up routine. It doesn't matter if they are six or sixteen, everyone loves to laugh.  Try to interject some humor into your lessons.</p>
<p>2.  Use a variety of technology.  You are teaching to children that have been spoon fed mass media from an early age.  Accept this, keep up with technology, and go for it.</p>
<p>3.  Provide hands-on experiences, allow exploration - supplement "book learning." </p>
<p>4.  Shock, drop and roll.  Gain their attention with extreme facts.  Think Guinness World Records TM and relate it to your subject, drop anecdotes, and if this fails, roll with it and return to step one.
   
5.  Let them learn from each other.  The ability to learn a concept is increased by trying to teach it to someone else. Encourage peer tutoring and coaching.</p>
