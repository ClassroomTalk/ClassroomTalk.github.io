<blockquote>My kids are going around the house all day singing the song "I Got That Boom Boom Pow" by the Black Eyed Peas.  Is  there  anything wrong with that?</p></blockquote>
<p>I'd heard parts of this song on the radio and when I saw this question, it started playing on repeat in my head. It's such a catchy tune that it was near impossible to get out of my mind.  The chorus keeps repeating itself, " I got that Boom Boom Pow... I got that natural style". I went to bed and kept waking up on the hour at 2, 3 and 4 am with that song playing in my head and disturbing my dreams, "I got that Boom Boom Pow... I got that natural style."   When I dragged myself out of bed in the morning it was still playing between my ears as I brushed my teeth and got ready for work,  "I Got That Boom Boom Pow... ."</p>
<p>When I looked it up online, it surprised me that there were two versions of the song. The "clean" version and the official version. I listened to both and trust me,  you wouldn’t want your 10 year old saying, much less singing, the original lyrics that contain a certain four  letter word frequently! Since then, I’ve found that there are several versions of the song and video. Some of them are appropriate for younger children and some are better suited to teenagers or adults. Who knew that there were so many choices? All this got me to thinking, are parents listening to what’s on their child’s iPod?  It’s probably time to give a listen and check in on what type and quality of music they are listening to. Without a doubt your teenagers may find the original version cooler than the cleaned up version. Which one do you want them listening to? Music has a subtle way of influencing who we are and how we see ourselves, this is especially true for tweens and teens. Elementary age children want to be that teenager. So please tune in and find out What that Boom Boom Pow is all about.</p>
