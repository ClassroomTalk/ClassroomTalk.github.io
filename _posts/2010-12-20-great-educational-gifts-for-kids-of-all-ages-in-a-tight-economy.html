<p>Here are some gift suggestions which may help you to save money this holiday season on educational gifts for children:</p>
<p>1.  Toddlers – Save that box your ‘fridge came in, or even if you splurge and buy something new, save the large box for your toddler.  A box big enough to climb into is a great toy to help stretch little imaginations.  The box can turn into a car, a space ship, a boat, a train, or even a clubhouse.  Older kids can get involved in painting and decorating.  Any parent that has experienced Christmas with a toddler will tell you that after all the gifts are opened and set aside, their toddler is still playing with the boxes the gifts came in.</p>
<p>2. Preschool - Books, books, and more books:  If you want to save big, hit up library and yard sales for gently used beautiful hard-covered books.  Your preschooler won’t know the difference.</p>
<p>3. Elementary School - The games, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112CHCK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=classrelemen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00112CHCK">Apples to Apples</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=classrelemen-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00112CHCK" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932188126?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=classrelemen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1932188126">Bananagrams</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=classrelemen-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1932188126" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> are both relatively cheap, and so fun that the kids won’t realize that they are playing educational games.  Tweens will enjoy these games too.</p>
<p>4. Middle School &amp; High School:  A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y27P3M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=classrelemen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002Y27P3M">Kindle</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=classrelemen-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002Y27P3M" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> will encourage reading while feeding your teens love of electronics.  Although the costs have come down (about $100) since last year, they are still expensive.  However, you will save money in the long run by being able to download discounted and even free books.</p>
<p>5. High School – For a tremendously less expensive initial output than it would cost you for a Kindle, give some of the older (paperback and discounted) but still relevant self-actualization books that have been so well received over the years.  In my opinion, the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743269519?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=classrelemen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0743269519">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=classrelemen-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0743269519" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> is a “must read” for young adults.</p>
