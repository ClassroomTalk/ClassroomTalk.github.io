<blockquote>What is a "blend?" My son’s teacher says that he will learn to read faster if he knows them.</p></blockquote>
<p>A consonant blend is two or more consecutive consonants in a word whose sounds blend together. Although the sounds "blend" together, each sound is still heard. These are examples of a <em>blend: </em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fr</span>y, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dr</span>ess, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sw</span>im and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">str</span>ing.</p>
<p>A consonant digraph is a group of consecutive consonants in a word which join to make one sound. These are examples of a <em>digraph</em>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wh</span>en, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wh</span>ere, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">th</span>ick, mu<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ch</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">kn</span>ow.</p>
<p>If you search, <em>consonant blend</em>, on the internet, you can find easily printable picture charts of blends. Your son’s teacher is right, once children learn the sounds that blends make they do learn to read faster.</p>
