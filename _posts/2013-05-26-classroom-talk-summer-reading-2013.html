<p>We love reviewing books here at Classroom talk, but this summer, we'd like to try something new: we want you (and your children) to be the reviewer.  Below are some suggestions to get you started, but we'd love to hear what you're reading this summer and what you think of it.</p>
<p>Post a comment with your summer reading book review on this post, and at the end of the summer, we'll post a list of the best-loved books of summer for different age groups.</p>
<p><strong>For Picture Book Readers</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1442406011/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1442406011&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=classrelemen-20">Spike, the Mixed-up Monster</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=classrelemen-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1442406011" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> by Susan Hood, illustrated by Melissa Sweet.  Great for ages 4 and up, this story combines lessons on friendship with easy to understand Spanish words.</p>
<p><strong>For Young Adults</strong>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0756966175/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0756966175&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=classrelemen-20">How I Live Now</a><img style="margin: 0px !important; border: currentColor !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=classrelemen-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0756966175" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> by Meg Rosoff.  Set in the not-too-distant future, How I Live Now follows Daisy, a fifteen year old living in England with her cousins.  The book deals with the tensions of a war-torn country, and the ties of family.  It is the winner of the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize.</p>
<p><strong>For Middle Grade Readers</strong></p>
<p>And, as always, we'd love to hear how you liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1463782594/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1463782594&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=classrelemen-20">Secrets of the Crystal Cavern</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=classrelemen-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1463782594" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. It's a great middle-grade read for summer and a fun gateway to <a title="Fantastic Fairy Houses" href="http://classroomtalk.com/?p=1252">outdoor activities </a>that will put an end to the boredom that seems to hit kids mid-July.</p>
