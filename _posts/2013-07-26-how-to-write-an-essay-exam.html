<p align="center"><strong>The most effective tips on writing an essay exam</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Guest Post By Lois Weldon</strong></p>
<p>Are you one of the many students who are wildly hoping to avoid the
overly-demanding essay exams? I am truly sorry, but that isn’t likely to
happen, as you will definitely find yourself taking an exam that isn’t solely
based on multiple choice answers, but demands wiring long or short essay
answers instead. This is particularly possible on exams for subjects like
political science, sociology, literature, philosophy and history. You should
not look at this as a punishment, because it can be really fun to think with
your own head and get away from the multiple choice answer routine from time to
time. By following the guidelines provided in this article, you are going to
ace your next essay exam and wish for more to come!</p>
<h2>Understand the questions!</h2>
<p>Being in a hurry to hand over your exam paper faster won’t get you any extraordinary
results. Take your time to read all questions thoroughly after the initial
phase of panic passes. Every question contains some keywords that can serve as
guidance for providing a focused answer. Focus your writing on the key points
and make sure to answer the question; do not go round and round just to write
something down!
When you read through all questions, some of them will fit within your comfort
level, while others will be completely confusing. Make sure to plan your time
wisely. Do not waste too much time starting with the most difficult questions,
because they can take all of your time away, they will make you nervous and you
won’t be able to answer the easier questions before you hand over the paper.</p>
<h2>Pay attention to each answer!</h2>
<p>Your paper won’t be marked with the highest score if you fail to provide decent
answers to each question. Providing only one good answer won’t get you anywhere
far, no matter how impressive it is. Each of your answers is like a mini-essay,
which means that you can create a special approach of wiring shortened versions
of the process you are used to when writing real, full-length essays. If you
spend some minutes in outlining your answers, that will save you a lot of
effort and time, so you will be able to answer all questions effectively.
Forget about re-writing an answer you are not satisfied with. You can allow yourself
that kind of luxury only if there is enough time after you answer all
questions. There is another reason why re-writing your answers is bad: the
cross outs will lead your instructor to the conclusion that you weren’t
prepared enough. However, if you outline your answers and write down some
marginal notes of the initial brainstorming process, your instructor will be
impressed by you for life… well, for the rest of the year to say the least.</p>
<h2>Answer the requirements!</h2>
<p>Your instructor may determine the exam to be answered in a rhetorical mode, which
requires analyzing, defining, comparing, evaluating, illustrating or
synthesizing the topic. You have to completely understand the requirements and
make sure to answer such questions appropriately.
Think of the answering process as drafting a full-length essay. Start your answer
with one or two direct statements that answer the question straight to the
point. These first statements equal the thesis statement of an actual essay,
which you will need to support with clear arguments and specific examples
further in the answer.</p>
<h2>Final tip: Academic level of writing</h2>
<p>You cannot answer the questions on your essay exam with the same language and
phrases you use while talking with your friends over coffee break. This is
where the practice of multiple choice answers has damaged the educational
system: most students aren’t aware of the rules of proper academic writing. You
cannot expect a high grade if you don’t sound educated enough for it.
It is very important to read your answers before you hand over the paper,
proofread them and make corrections if necessary. Don’t do the corrections by crossing
out and making a complete mess; make sure to make only the necessary
corrections, in a legible and neat way.</p>
