<p>Written by an educator, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1463782594/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=picthiteawitp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1463782594">Secrets of the Crystal Cavern</a><img title="Secrets of the Crystal Cavern" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=picthiteawitp-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1463782594" alt=" Secrets of the Crystal Cavern" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> is a fun read about a brother and sister who find themselves in the middle of an adventure with fairies one summer.  When Nina finds a half drowned fairy clinging to her screen one summer night, she never imagined what would happen next.  As Nina and Jack rush to help the fairy before it’s too late, they embark on adventure after adventure and happen upon the secret of the Crystal Caverns.</p>
<p>The description the author used really made the story pop and made the reader feel as if he or she were there.  As an educator, I could see using excerpts of the story to model visualization.  This would be a fun read aloud for third grade or above.  Independent readers in 3rd grade and above would also enjoy this fast-paced adventure/fantasy.</p>
