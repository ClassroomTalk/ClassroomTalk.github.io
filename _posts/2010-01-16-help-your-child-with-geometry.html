<p>Learning the proper term for solid shapes at an early age gives your child a head start in geometry.  It’s very simple to teach them some proper names.</p>
<ol>
<li>Call a can a cylinder.</li>
<li>Call dice or square boxes a cube.</li>
<li>A CD case or a cereal box is a rectangular prism.</li>
<li>A  ball or a globe is a sphere.</li>
<li>A cone shape at the primary level is just like an ice cream cone.</li>
<li>A pyramid can easily be shown to a child courtesy of almost any book on ancient Egypt.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you use the objects proper name and then its “household” name interchangeably, children can learn about a variety of 3D solid shapes before they enter kindergarten.</p>
<p>To take this lesson to the next level, talk about the number of sides (faces) of a shape, the number of corners (vertices) and what shapes have common attributes.  Does it roll?  Can you slide it?  What shape appears if you trace around the bottom of it with a pencil.</p>
