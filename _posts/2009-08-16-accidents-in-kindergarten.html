<blockquote>My soon to be kindergartner still has “accidents.”  What should I do when I send him to school?</p>
<p>V.S. Atlanta, GA.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm assuming that you've already discussed the problem with your son's pediatrician.  I'd suggest that you pack an emergency change of clothes (shoes and socks too) and wipes in his backpack.  You should let the teacher know from start that the bathroom is an issue.  Many teachers have instructional teaching time when they don't like students to use the bathroom.  If your son's teacher is aware of the problem, he or she and your son can work out a plan or private signal for emergencies.</p>
