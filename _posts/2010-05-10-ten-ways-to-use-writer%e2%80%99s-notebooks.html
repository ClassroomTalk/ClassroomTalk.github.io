<p>  Writer’s notebooks are typically used in the classroom to house ideas, favorite quotes, and just general nuggets of information.  At any time, the information within these notebooks may be turned into a writing piece. </p>
<p>I like to encourage my own children to view writing as a fun, active form of communication.  I also like to encourage the connection between reading and writing as often as possible.  Here are ten ways a writer’s notebook may be used:</p>
<p> Create a list of books you have read or want to read.  Keep the list(s) in your notebook.</p>
<ol>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<li>Write down how a book made you feel when you finished reading it. </li>
<li>Use your notebook to keep a list of ideas (“writing seeds”) that you may want to write about.  Use your real life to help you with your ideas.  Memories are often the start of a great writing piece.</li>
<li>Keep a running list of funny, scary, embarrassing, etc. things that happen to you.  You never know, one day, one may make a great story.</li>
<li>Keep a list of facts about topics that interest you. </li>
<li>Write down character traits of your favorite characters.  How does he or she behave?  Use examples from the books you have read.  </li>
<li> Clip out articles from the newspaper or magazines such as Scholastic News or Time for Kids.  The topic may spur a writing piece.</li>
<li>Write down questions you have.  What do you wonder about?  Try to answer the questions</li>
<li>Make a sensory section of your notebook.  When you are in new situations, stop for a minute.  What do you hear? What do you smell?  What do you see?  Write it all dow</li>
<li>Write down interesting things people say.  Real people and characters in books.      </li>
</ol>
<p> If you are like me and you like to tie in literature with other activities, then Amelia’s Notebook (and the other books in the series) by Marissa Moss is the perfect book to read to introduce Writer’s Notebooks.  Check out my post at <a href="http://teachingwithpicturebooks.wordpress.com/2008/09/18/amelias-notebook-by-marissa-moss-2/">Teaching with Picture Books</a> for an idea of how to get started with Writer’s Notebooks.  I wrote that post for use in the classroom, but I think it can easily be modified to use at home as well!   </p>
