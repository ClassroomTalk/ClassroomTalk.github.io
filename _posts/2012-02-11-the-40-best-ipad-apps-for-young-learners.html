<p>The best way to get your parents to
buy you expensive gadgets has always been to really sell the educational value.
“But Mom, if you buy me a Nintendo, think about how much my spelling will
improve playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVM5w-NrxH8">Wheel of Fortune</a>.”
Of course, these days it’s all about the iPad. For every Angry Birds there’s an
<a href="http://www.onlinecolleges.net/online-degree-programs-by-discipline/">educational</a>
game out there to improve your child’s mind. Here are 40 of the best apps for
your young Einstein. Most of them are paid apps, but if you’ve got $500 to drop
on an iPad, we’re thinking you won’t mind.</p>
