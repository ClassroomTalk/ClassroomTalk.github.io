<p>Every family with preschool and primary age children should have a set of magnetic letters on their refrigerator.  They are a fun and easy teaching tool.  Here are a few activities for preschoolers:</p>
<p>1)   Make the names of people and animals in the family.</p>
<p>2)  Sort upper and lower case letters.  Pair and match upper and lower case letters.</p>
<p>3)  Sort letters by color.</p>
<p>4)  Put the letters in alphabetical order while singing the ABC song.</p>
<p>5)  Make simple words.  Copy environmental print such as cereal names off  boxes.</p>
