<p>So every class has that one student who tends to
think they are on the set of Saturday Night Live and feels the need to practice
their stand up during your class. Secretly you are chuckling inside but in all
seriousness your class clowns antics are disrupting your class. Most of the
time the class clown is the kid that all of your students love the most, so
being rough on your class clown could turn his/her fans against you. Here are a
few tricks to handling that goof ball:</p>
<p><strong>Do
not laugh:</strong> Whatever you do, do not laugh. Laughing will only
encourage that kind of behavior. The funnies may not be a bad thing but there
is a time and place for everything. You laughing will only entice your class
clown to continue to crack jokes.</p>
<p><strong>Pull
them aside</strong>: No need to call the class clown out in front of
the class. If they are disrupting your class, let them have their moment and
then pull them aside with the class is busy on their work. If all else fails,
keep them after class to speak with them.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What
to say:</strong> Most teachers find it easier to inform the class
clown that they are not mad but would prefer they kept their jokes outside f
the class room. As much as you appreciate a good comedy every now and then you
are there to teach them.</p>
<p><strong>Donâ€™t
fight comedy with comedy:</strong> As much as you want to come back
with a clever and quick witted statement or action, doing this will only spark
your class clowns comedic fire. They will see this as a challenge and that you
accept their clever witty ways. Handle the class clown as you would with a
class bully or the class talker, firm but kind.</p>
<p>To keep the giggles and knee slaps to a minimum follow these few funny tips to gain control of your
classroom again. Remember not to laugh and be kind to the student, they are
children that thoroughly enjoy making others happy and laugh.</p>
