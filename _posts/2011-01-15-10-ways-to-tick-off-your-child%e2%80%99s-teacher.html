<p>If you want to start the New Year right, avoid doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask about how your child is doing at pick-up in front of other parents, instead of scheduling a conference.</li>
<li>Send your child to school without a jacket when it’s below 60 degrees.</li>
<li>Assume that just because you can skip breakfast once in a while, it’s ok for your child to do the same.</li>
<li>Think that a donut or any other sugary breakfast is a good way to start the school day.</li>
<li>Encourage your child to keep a cell phone on in their backpack in case you need to reach them.</li>
<li>Be late for pickup.</li>
<li>Forget to check your child’s homework, backpack or folder.</li>
<li>Force the teacher to send you several reminders before you remember to send back in permission slips or other important papers.</li>
<li>Make excuses for your child’s inappropriate behavior.</li>
<li>Let your child stay up as late as he wants.</li>
</ol>
