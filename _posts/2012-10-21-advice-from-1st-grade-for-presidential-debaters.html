<p>The presidential debate is coming to Boca Raton, my hometown.  In the midst of this
truly exciting event I'd just like the candidates to remember  a
few ground rules that  they probably
learned in 1st grade.</p>
<p>1. Be kind.</p>
<p>2. Stay in your own personal space.</p>
<p>3. Tell the truth.</p>
<p>4. Take responsibility for your actions.</p>
<p>5. No interrupting each other.</p>
<p>I could go on but 5 rules is usually the perfect number to
be able to follow in 1st Grade.</p>
