<p>Tales From 1st Grade</p>
<p>I've decided to mix it up a bit and share my day with you.
Names have been changed to protect the innocent and let me add that I like to
exaggerate a bit from time to time. All facts on this page are probably not
true. Life is funny, kids are sometimes funny and I often find that I can't
stop smiling during my days in 1st grade and that's a good thing. So I'd like
to share some of my many moments with you. Please let me know how you like it.
If you're a teacher with a tale of a good
or unique day please send it to me through  classroomtalk.com and I'll  add it to my blog.</p>
<p>1. Note from a parent: "Johnny swallowed a marble. Can
you please look for it?"</p>
<p>2. Question from a 1st grade girl to the teacher:
"What's it like living life in high heels?"</p>
<p>3. Serious student
writing "nonfiction : "You should never take a raccoon to the
bank."</p>
