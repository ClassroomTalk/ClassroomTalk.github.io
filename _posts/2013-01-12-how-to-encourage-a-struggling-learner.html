<p>Learning to read can be one of life’s
most stressful events for a child. For some children, picking up phonics and
spelling seems like second nature. For others, the reading process sparks
long-lasting low confidence and a chronic distaste for schoolwork. Parents
often find it difficult to know how to build up self-confidence in a child
while also correcting their mistakes. Pairing praise and criticism is not an
easy job, so we have a special rule that helps to keep the two in balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Rule of 5” says that as a parent
you must say five encouraging remarks to your child before you can say
something negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I can’t let my child get away with
reading a word wrong, can I? You might ask this question – and it’s a good one!
Our children do need a lot of correction as they grow. But the problem is that
even the most well-meaning correction will always come across to a child as a
harsh criticism. Even children with high confidence tend to take correction
badly. We’ve found that once you practice a praise-first policy, children
become more open to hearing instruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve called this idea The Rule of 5 in
order to make the model more tangible. You might want to pledge to a Rule of 3
or a Rule of 7, depending on your child. The idea is that once you have a
numerical target to reach, it is easier to measure your success. We always
perform better to specific challenges than general ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially if your child struggles with
school and has fragile self-esteem, The Rule of 5 not only increases confidence
but also will usually improve academic performance. Stress can be a main <a href="http://www.easyreadsystem.com/info/dyslexia.html">cause of reading difficulty</a>, because your body responds to
stress by shutting down the learning centers in the brain. This is a part of
the “fight or flight” response. The body focuses all of its energy on
responding to the threat, at the expense of non-essential functioning like digestion
and learning. So once some of that school-related stress has been alleviated,
the brain is much better prepared for the learning environment.</p>

<p>If The Rule of Five is a new concept, give it
a try over the course of one week. I am sure that you
will love the outcome!</p>
