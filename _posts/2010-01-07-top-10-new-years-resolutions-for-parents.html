<p><em> </em></p>
<p>1. Get to school on time. If school starts at 8 am its starts at 8 am. Children that are even five minutes late miss important directions and interrupt others that have gotten to school on time.</p>
<p>2. Check to see if your child has homework. Then make sure that they do it. Then check it to make sure that it was done correctly.</p>
<p>3. If your child is sick keep them home. Have a back up plan. If your child is going to be out for a few days pick up missed work from the teacher.</p>
<p>4. Get organized. Write assignments for class projects on the family calendar. Have a basket by the front door for books, folders and papers that need to be returned to school.</p>
<p>5. Plan lunches, outfits and play dates the night before so that mornings become stress free for everyone.</p>
<p>6. Make sure that your child has an age appropriate bedtime.</p>
<p>7. The school year is almost half over. Check in with your child’s teacher to schedule a conference and see what skills you need to help them work on.</p>
<p>8. Don’t ask your child’s teacher how they are doing when the teacher is at dismissal or you’ve dropped your child late to class. Make an appointment.</p>
<p>9. Try to attend a parent workshop. If your school offers extra help and your child needs it find a way to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>10. Volunteer to help out in the classroom, attend a field trip or do prep work at home if you can’t make it to school because of work.</p>
