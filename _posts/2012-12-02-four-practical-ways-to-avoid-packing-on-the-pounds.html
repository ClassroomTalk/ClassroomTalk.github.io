<p><strong>Guest  Post By Melissa  Miller</strong></p>
<p>We've all heard the horror stories regarding weight
gain in college. Through Facebook, I've seen one too many pictures of high
school jocks and homecoming queens going off to college only to return looking
much more filled out. It's a sad tale, and it happens more than it should. Even
though it's a highly publicized trend, thousands of freshman students still
manage to gain unwanted weight each and every year. What gives? Well, aside
from the fact that freshman are being introduced to a whole new world of
late-night study sessions and intensive, stressful courses, they often find
themselves reaching for one-too-many midnight snacks, skipping their daily
exercise sessions, and drowning their sorrows and stresses in alcohol. If
you're preparing to venture off to university for the first time or just want
to integrate some healthier habits into your routine, here are four ways to
avoid packing on the pounds in college.</p>
<p><strong>Find
a Devoted Workout Buddy </strong></p>
<p>Working out is the best way to avoid weight gain.
Unfortunately, it's ever so easy to neglect your normal workout routine in
college, especially when you get overloaded and busy. Although you might want
to attend every party possible and cram in as much last-minute studying as you
can, you should never skimp on workouts. If you realize you're not hitting the
gym as much as you should, the best thing to do is find an inspiring, reliable
workout buddy. As long as they drag you to the gym as opposed to ice cream
socials, then you and your partner should be able to stick to a solid,
effective routine.</p>
<p><strong>Keep
a Food Diary</strong></p>
<p>This is a tedious tip, but it's a helpful one.
Sometimes we deny how much we've been eating when we notice we've gained
weight. Especially when you're having a good time, the last thing you want to
admit is that you've been overindulging or living unhealthy. Eating sinful
foods every once in a while can't hurt, but when it becomes a habit, you're
only doing harm to your body. To prevent unexpected calories from creeping up
on your waistline, document every single thing you eat in a journal. By making
yourself acknowledge every morsel and crumb that enters your mouth, you'll be
able to hold yourself accountable for any weight gain.</p>
<p><strong>Join
Weight Watchers</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to solve a problem is to
prevent it from happening in the first place. <a href="http://www.weightwatchers.com/">Weight Watchers</a> isn't just a source
for people losing weight; it's also a helpful outlet for those trying to
maintain weight. By joining Weight Watchers, you'll preemptively strike and
prevent weight gain from happening in the first place. The Weight Watchers
system is a highly successful, highly trusted resource, so if you're really
serious about avoiding any weight gain whatsoever, join Weight Watchers and
start tracking your daily food intake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Weigh
Yourself Every Day</strong></p>
<p>Scales can either be your friend or your foe; it's
up to you. If you make time for stepping on the scale every morning, you'll be
able to recognize and acknowledge any weight problems as they come. The longer
you delay it, however, the more dreadful your weigh-ins will become. I've had
friends who say they limit their weigh-ins to once a week, as weight does tend
to fluctuate from day to day. Yet I think it's a much better idea to weigh
every day, since once a week is much easier to skip out on. So as much as you
might hate it, go ahead and step on the scale every morning. Once you see your
weight remember it and then repeat the routine again the next morning. Keep up
the habit and before you know it you won't even blink twice when you step on
the scale. Heck, it might even become something you look forward to.</p>
<p>Weight gain is not a pleasant topic to talk about,
yet it's something almost everybody struggles with from time to time. If you're
about to venture off to college, try integrating these four habits into your
routine to prevent gaining any weight.</p>
