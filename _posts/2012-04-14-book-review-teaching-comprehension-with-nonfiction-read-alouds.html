<p>I am in the midst of a teaching unit on nonfiction and was
thrilled to have this resource. If you're a regular reader of classroomtalk.com
you have had the opportunity to benefit from Dawn Little's wealth of knowledge
on literacy from her guest posts on this site.</p>
<p>The author does a fantastic job of breaking down lessons
into easy to teach components by scaffolding instruction. The book written for
teachers of grades 3-6 has lessons for using newspapers, magazines and other
nonfiction texts to teach comprehension skills. It was my experience that some
of the lessons can be simplified and used in grades 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The book utilizes standard ways to activate prior knowledge
through graphic organizers like the use of
K-W-L charts, but also introduces contemporary bridges to instruction
like the "Word Splash." This step by step guide to teaching literacy
will be helpful to teachers and home school families as well. Published by
Scholastic, <em>Teaching Comprehension With
Nonfiction Read Alouds</em> is available through Amazon.com.   <a href="http://amzn.to/HIV2yb">http://amzn.to/HIV2yb</a></p>
