<p>Guest Post By Allison Foster</p>
<p>Online education offers students a flexible way to enhance their academic learning outside of the regular classroom. While the popularity of online classes initially began in the college setting, more public and private school systems are beginning to utilize online education in their programs from kindergarten through high school as research has begun to show the significant advantages that are offered through these courses. However, it is important to know that online learning does require some additional study strategies in order for students to be successful. For this reason, the following ideas are offered to help online learners get the most from their courses.</p>
<p>1. Follow a schedule-Success in an online classroom depends upon a student’s motivation to study. For this reason, it is important to make sure that a regular schedule is followed for attending classes. This can be done by outlining a basic routine for when a student will log into their courses as well as when they will study.</p>
<p>2. Utilize technology-In a virtual environment, knowing how to use technology becomes very important. Knowing how to email, upload assignments and navigate through a course’s website is essential for being able to access course materials and complete assignments. Additionally, the use of technology will enhance the learning experience by offering the capability to turn learning into a multi-sensory experience.</p>
<p>3. Emphasize communication-Many times, students in an online environment feel disconnected from their peers and teachers. This can be avoided by making sure that the student is engaged with their classmates and educators by using a variety of methods. Many online schools encourage communication through emails, discussion forums and specially designed web chatting software that can create a very interactive experience for students.</p>
<p>4. Create a study space-Learning online has the advantage of being able to be done from home. Unfortunately, many homes have a lot of distractions such as televisions, telephones and the constant coming and going of other family members. For this reason, a special area for studying should be set up that is quiet and comfortable for the student. The space should also stay organized so that the students will not have to waste time looking for information or lose track of what needs to be accomplished next. </p>
<p>5. Explore the benefits-One of the greatest advantages of online schools is that they offer flexible formatting. This can be used to adapt an educational program to a student’s learning style. For example, a student who has difficulty focusing can take frequent breaks in order to avoid frustration. Additionally, real-life opportunities, such as visiting a museum or zoo, can be incorporated into a student’s study program so that they have a chance to apply their new knowledge in a real world setting.</p>
<p>When a student enrolls in an online school, they enter an environment that is full of possibilities. Therefore, it is important to establish some basic study strategies, such as following a schedule, learning technology and communicating with their peers, so that they can get the most benefits from the flexibility that an online program provides.
