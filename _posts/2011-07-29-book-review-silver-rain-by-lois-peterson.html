<p>One of the many things I love about summer is that I get to do more reading. When I read a good book I just have to share it with everyone. <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554692806/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=classrelemen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1554692806" target="_blank">SilverRain</a></strong><strong>  by Lois Peterson </strong>is one of those books. It would be a great addition to your summer reading list.</p>
<p>The Depression of the 1930s was tough on everyone, and it hit Elsie’s family hard. After they lost their house and her Dad went missing, and then when her mom and uncle left her alone with her grandmother; she couldn’t imagine things could get any worse. But as her Nan often said, “Desperate times sometimes call for desperate measures,” and Elsie will stop at nothing to get her family back together again.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful book that takes you back to another time with vivid descriptions of shantytowns, hobos and degrading dance marathons. Lois Peterson has skillfully painted a perfect picture of the resiliency and determination of youth in the character of eleven year old Elsie. I highly recommend this book for young people, not just as a peek into the past but as encouragement to deal with the inevitable tough times in life. It is also a fun read with colourful characters, great use of language of the period and lots of action. Adults will love it too.</p>
<p>Silver Rain is available at most bookstores and on Amazon</p>
<p><strong>Have you read anything worthy of sharing?  Happy summer reading!</strong></p>
